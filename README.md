## C++ Basics Practice
 
This repository contains basic practice programs written in C++.
Each program is focused on a simple concept like variables, input/output, conditionals, loops, and functions.
 
## Whatâ€™s inside?
 
| Filename            | Description                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| average.cpp         | Calculates the average of three numbers |
| age_converter.cpp           | Converts age in years to days, hours, minutes, and seconds. |
| even_numbers_in_range.cpp      | Prints even numbers between two integers.   |
| gcd.cpp        | Finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.   |
| max_of_three.cpp | Finds the largest among three numbers. |
| rectangle_recursive.cpp | Calculates area and perimeter of a rectangle using recursive functions. |
| factorial_compare.cpp | Calculates factorial of a number using both loop and recursion methods. Great for understanding iterative vs recursive logic. |
| factorial_compare.cpp    | Calculates factorial of a number using both loop and recursion methods. Great for understanding iterative vs recursive logic. |
| power_function.cpp       | Calculates a raised to the power of b using a loop.               |
| prime_check.cpp          | Checks if a number is prime using a boolean function.             |
| lcm_calculator.cpp       | Calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) using GCD helper.      |
| CheckDigitSumEven.cpp        | Checks whether the sum of digits of a number is even.         |
| CountPrimeInRange.cpp        | Counts how many prime numbers exist between two given numbers.|
| ReverseAndCheckPalindrome.cpp| Reverses a number and checks if it's a palindrome.            |
| FindMaxInArray.cpp       | Gets 5 numbers from the user and finds the largest one using a simple loop. Focuses on array traversal and conditional logic. |
| SumAndAverage.cpp        | Calculates the sum and average of numbers stored in an array. Separates input, processing, and output logic into functions.   |
| CountEvenOdd.cpp         | Counts how many even and odd numbers exist in a fixed-size array. Demonstrates modular design and use of conditional operators.|
