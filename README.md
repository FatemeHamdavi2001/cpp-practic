## C++ Basics Practice
 
This repository contains basic practice programs written in C++.
Each program is focused on a simple concept like variables, input/output, conditionals, loops, and functions.

| SumSecondaryDiagonal.cpp   | Calculates the sum of the secondary (reverse) diagonal. Uses row + column == size - 1 condition.        |
| StringLength.cpp  | Loops through each character to count the total length without using `length()` directly. |
| ReverseString.cpp | Uses loop from end to start to build the reversed string manually. |
| CountVowels.cpp   | Checks each character with `if` for all vowels (a, e, i, o, u - both cases). |
| IsPalindrome.cpp  | Compares original and reversed strings to check if they match. |
| FindWord.cpp      | Uses `find()` to locate a word inside a full sentence. |
| ReplaceWord.cpp   | Finds the target word and replaces it with another using `find()` + `erase()` + `insert()`. |
| SplitWords.cpp    | Uses `istringstream` to extract words one by one from sentence. |
